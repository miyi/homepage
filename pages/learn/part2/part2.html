      Modules in dagger are code snippets that help users maximize code
      reusability.
    </div>
    <div class="text">
      In part 1 of the tutorial we created components with scopes and directives
      all within a single html page, but as projects become more complex, we can
      use modules to create abstractions and reuse code. In dagger any reusable
      resource is called a module.
    </div>
    <div class="text">
      Main module types:
      <ul>
        <li>script modules: javascript resources in ESM format.</li>
        <li>style modules: css resources.</li>
        <li>
          view modules: html fragments. You can use it by inserting the module
          name as an element tag.
        </li>
        <li>namespace: a collection of modules, including other namespaces.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="text">
      In the following example we recreated the part 1 example using modules. To
      start let's create a file structure for the following 4 files, with
      cardList.html as the root file of our project.
    </div>
    <div class="flex-grid">
      <img style="width: 700px" src="/img/file_struc1.png" />
    </div>
    <demo_container>
      <div class="flex-grid">
        <demo_html +loading="scene1.loadingCard()"></demo_html>
        <demo_js +loading="scene1.loadingCardListJs()"></demo_js>
      </div>
      <div class="flex-grid">
        <demo_html +loading="scene1.loadingCardList()"></demo_html>
        <demo_browser +loading="{html: scene1.loadingBrowser()}"></demo_browser>

    <div class="text">
      CardList.html created a namespace by defining a modules config via the
      <script type="dagger/modules">
        ...
      </script>
      tag. Inside the config object, the key is a self defined module name, and
      the value is the location of the module resource, which could be a local
      DOM selector of the current file, or a remote URL.
    </div>
    <div class="text">
      There are 3 modules defined in the modules config above: card, js, and
      css. Dagger can automatically detect the module type, but there are also
      ways to set content type manually (docs). Additionally, a module will only
      take effect inside its owner namespace.
    </div>
    <div class="text">
      Any html file with a dagger/modules config is considered a namespace.
      Conceptually, a namespace is simply a collection of modules. Since
      namespace is also a type of module, we can reference a namespace inside
      other namespaces in a tree structure. Sitting at the very top of the tree
      is the root namespace. It is a special-case namespace defined in the entry
      file with no parent namespace. Think of it like the starting point of
      dagger, all dagger projects can only have one root namespace.
    </div>
    <div class="text">
      let's see how namespace works in nested scenarios. First we start with the
      folder structure.

        <demo_js +loading="scene2.loadingFetch()"></demo_js>
        <demo_html +loading="scene2.loadingRoot()"></demo_html>
      </div>

    <div class="text">
      We can render view modules inside the "card_list" namespace by calling its
      module path. We can directly call the card module inside root.html by
      writing &lt;card_list.card&gt;. Non-root namespace assumes that the view
      module named "view" is the default render. For example, in root.html, when
      we inserted &lt;card_list&gt; we actually inserted the
      &lt;card_list.view&gt;.
    </div>
    <div class="text">
      Root.html is the root namespace, the starting point of the dagger project
      and where we load the dagger.js file into the head. The root namespace
      renders from the &lt;body&gt; by default, so you don't need to reference a
      default view module inside dagger/modules config to initiate render.
    </div>
    <div class="text">
      Let's take a closer look at a few other changes we made. The cardView.html
      file is the same in both this example and the one before. cardList.html on
      the other hand is now a nested namespace. We moved the data fetching logic
      from inside the cardList.html to root.html. This way we can create
      multiple card_list instances, and assign different card data to each.
    </div>
    <div class="text">
      additionally we also moved the active scope scope variable from to the
      root namespace so that only one card among all the card lists can be
      expanded at a time.
    </div>
    <div class="text">let's see the next example with more namespaces.</div>
    <demo_container>
      <div class="flex-grid">
        <demo_html +loading="scene3.loadingRoot()"></demo_html>
        <demo_html +loading="scene3.loadingSubmitForm()"></demo_html>
      </div>
      <div class="flex-grid">
        <demo_browser +loading="{html: scene3.loadingBrowser()}"></demo_browser>
      </div>
    </demo_container>
    <div class="text">
      This example added the "submit_form" namespace to the previous example.
      The "submit_form" contains a button that toggles a dialog element
      containing the submission modal. The modal gathers the new task card info
      such title, assignee, and details, as well as which list the user would
      like to submit to, the submit button then pushes that info to either list1
      or list2 via $scope.
    </div>
    <div class="text">
      We introduced a few new ways to use dagger here. Inside submitForm.html,
      the "bs_style" module referenced the external bootstrap css cdn, and
      "modal" referenced a view module through its id selector then inserted in
      the default view. This is just to demonstrate some of the ways we can
      leverage abstractions in dagger.
    </div>
    <div class="text">
      There are also two new control directives: $watch and $exist. $watch
      watches for changes in the scope variables in the assigned expression.
      $exist toggles the existence of the element based on whether assigned
      expression returns true or false. The html dialog element comes with its
      own javascript handlers to toggle its visibility, but dagger offers a
      simpler solutions to the modal problem.
    </div>
    <div class="text">
      We also introduced the use of decorators in the modal module. You can find
      these in the directives +click#prevent and +click#outside. These are
      syntactic sugars for repetitive logics, or shorthands, to give users
      better control of the element. The #prevent decorator is the dagger
      shorthand for Event.preventDefault(). The +click#outside is a +click
      specific decorator that triggers when the user clicks outside of the
      element, in this case clicking outside of the modal sets the exist scope
      variable to false, and in turn toggles $exist to false.
    </div>
    <div class="text">
      Under the hood dagger is constructing a module tree of all the modules
      needed for the render, and then loads these modules in run time. In real
      projects, the tree depth could be deep and many modules pop in and out of
      use. If some modules share the same dependencies, dagger will load the
      shared dependencies from its cache instead of refetching the resource.
