      This part is about introducing basic ways to use dagger with directives
      and scopes. Let's see how that works with a simple task card example.
    </div>
    <demo_container +loading="scene1.loadingData()">
      <div class="flex-grid">
        <demo_html +loading="scene1.loadingHtml()"></demo_html>
        <demo_browser
          $watch="html=scene1.loadingBrowserHtml()"
          +loading="{html: ''}"
        ></demo_browser>
      </div>
    </demo_container>
    <div class="text">
      The +loading lifecycle directive created 3 scope variables that are then
      stored in the $scope object. Like javascript scoping rules, these scope
      variables are accessible anywhere inside the element tags.
    </div>
    <div class="text">
      to read the scope variables we used the \${} control directive. It outputs
      the scope variables as strings, and will update the DOM on change. Try
      change the scope variables yourself!
    </div>
    <div class="text">
      Next up we will manipulate $scope to create a more interactive task card.
    </div>
    <demo_container +loading="scene2.loadingData()">
      <div class="flex-grid">
        <demo_html +loading="scene2.loadingHtml()"></demo_html>
        <demo_browser
          $watch="html=scene2.loadingBrowser(
          dollar_class,
          complete,
          complete_btn_click,
          collapse_btn_click,
          title,
          assignee,
          details,
          collapse)"
          +loading="{html: ''}"
        ></demo_browser>
      </div>
    </demo_container>
    <div class="text">
      We added 2 more scope variables complete and collapse with boolean data
      type. We also added +click even directive to the title div and the
      complete button. Clicking on the elements will trigger its respective
      expressions.
    </div>
    <div class="text">
      First we created a mechanism to mutate the scope variables. Then we added
      the $class directive to insert appropriate styling to match the data.
      $class watches the scope variables inside its assigned plain object for
      change. It will insert the scope variable name into the html element
      classname whenever the scope variable evaluates as true, and will remove
      when it evaluates to false.
    </div>
    <div class="title">Nested Scopes</div>
    <div class="text">
      In the above example we created a single scope. We can also create nested
      scope structures to enable components to talk to each other. Dagger
      scoping rules behave in the exact same way as javascript scopes. We can
      coordinate multiple components by utilizing the outer scope variables
      inside the inner scopes.
    </div>
    <div class="text">Let's see a nested scope example:</div>
    <demo_container>
      <div class="flex-grid">
        <demo_html +loading="scene3.loadingHtml()"></demo_html>
        <demo_browser +loading="{html: scene3.loadingBrowser()}"></demo_browser>
      </div>
    </demo_container>
    <div class="text">
      There are 2 card components nested inside the outer container element. A
      couple of things are different in this example and we will go through them
      one by one.
      <ul>
        <li>
          The outer container scope has a "cards" array with all the info of
          each card inside.
        </li>
        <li>
          The card element added a $each control directive which will iterate
          over the cards array and render a card component for each element.
          $each creates a new scope for each card and stores the iterated values
          in $scope.item.
        </li>
        <li>
          The "active" value in the outer scope represents the id of the card
          that isn't in collapse mode, meaning only 1 card can be active at a
          time.
        </li>
        <li>
          You may notice that we changed complete from the previous example to
          item.complete. This is because $class runs after $each.
        </li>
        <li>
          the title element's +click directive directly mutate "active" variable
          of the outer scope. Clicking on the title will match the active id
          with the card id. The $class directive will see the active id change,
          and update the collapse classname.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="flex-grid center">
      <img style="width: 700px" src="/img/scope_diag.png" />
    </div>
    <div class="link-container">
      <div class="link-grid">
        <part_card +loading="{part_number: 2}"></part_card>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div +loading="{number: produce4()}">
      ${number}
